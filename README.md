# ðŸŽµ Spektrum

An interactive multiplayer music quiz where players compete to identify songs through colors and characters.

## How to Play

Spektrum is meant to be played with all participants in the same room. One person acts as the host and is responsible for music playback. The host creates a lobby and shares the join code with the group. When players have joined, the host starts the game.

Players will hear a piece of music and must identify the correct color or character associated with each song. Quick answers score more points.
